<h1>Services</h1>
<p>With more than 30 years experience in the IT industry, there is much I can offer.</p>
<p>If you have availed yourself of the opportunity to familiarise yourself with my <a href="/about">my professional background</a>, you will have noticed that I have worked in a variety of capacities with many different technologies. I have represented and provided services to organisations ranging from small businesses to multinational corporations.</p>
<p>In late 2007 I founded <a href="http://www.cockatoosoftware.com.au">Cockatoo Software</a>. In March 2014 I began working in a permanent role for Blake eLearning, so my availability is now limited to evenings and weekends. I also value my work/life balance so I am likely to be fairly selective about what extra work I take on.</p>
<p>Having said that, if you would like to know more, please explore <a href="http://www.cockatoosoftware.com.au/services">the services I offer</a> via my company, <a href="http://www.cockatoosoftrware.com.au">Cockatoo Software</a>.</p>
